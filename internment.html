      <div id="conscription-about">
        <p>
          In February 1942, the Canadian government issued a decree allowing for the internment of 
          Japanese-Canadians as enemy aliens under the War Measures act. On March 16, the first Japanese were detained, 
          and families divided. Some were offered the option of laboring on beet farms for a meager wage to keep their families intact. 
          The properties of the Japanese peoples were auctioned off to pay for their own internment. After the war ended, Prime Minister Mackenzie King 
          gave the detainees the option to move inland, away from the rocky mountains, or to leave for Japan. Approximately 4000 internees took the latter choice.
           On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister <span class="important-info">Brian Mulroney
            <span class="tooltip-text">Brian Mulroney was the prime minister of Canada from 1984-1993.</span>
           </span> formally issued an apology for the treatment of Japanese peoples in WW2. 
        <p>
          Why is this defining? <br>
          The internment of Japanese peoples in Canada comprises a dark chapter in Canadian history. Although Canada nowadays is seen as an accepting nation, this unveils the stigma that existed against Japanese peoples at the time. In addition,  Japanese internment is a prime example of a human rights violation in Canadian history. The RCMP and military advised against the internment, and no Japanese-Canadian was ever found of any wrongdoing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Cause and Consequence <br>
          Japanese internment was motivated by several key causes. Racism against 
          Japanese-Canadians prevailed at the time, and often escalated to violence. Furthermore, people of Asian descent were not permitted to vote, 
          thus showing how they were considered less by the other citizens. In addition, wartime paranoia heavily incited the internment. 
          After the <span class="important-info">Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
            <span class="tooltip-text">On December 7, 1941, the Japanese navy launched an attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.</span>
          </span>, it was feared that the west coast of Canada would be targeted next. Thus, pressure was put on the government for the removal of Japanese peoples from the west coast. Finally, resentment of Japanese immigrants caused them to be unwanted among non-asian people. Japanese fishermen comprised a large component of BC’s fishing fleet, and therefore were seen as competition by non-Japanese fishermen.
