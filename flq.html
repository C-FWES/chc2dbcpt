          The Front de Liberation du Quebec was formed in 1963 with the goal of
          complete independence of Quebec. The FLQ resorted to violence to
          garner their demands, using tactics such as robberies, bombings, and
          kidnappings. On October 5, 1970, the FLQ captured James Cross, a
          British trade commissioner. For his release, they demanded the release
          of FLQ prisoners, the publication of the FLQ manifesto, and the
          ability of FLQ members to leave for Cuba. Following this on October
          10, Pierre Laporte, a Quebec minister, was also kidnapped by the FLQ.
          Premier Robert Bourassa eventually asked for military assistance in
          Quebec, and announced some concessions. On October 16,

              "Trudeaumania".</span

          invoked the War Measures Act, criminalizing membership in the FLQ,
          suspending civil liberties, and allowing unauthorized arrests. On
          October 17, Pierre Laporte’s body was found strangled in the trunk of
          an abandoned car. In early December, James Cross was finally released
          in healthy condition.

          Why is this defining?<br />
          The October Crisis was the sole occurrence of the Wartime Measures Act
          being invoked during peacetime. This highlights the increasing tension
          in Quebec during the period, and the desperation of the government to
          restore order to the province. In addition, daily life for many
          Canadians was disrupted by the futile acts of terrorism, such as
          bombings and kidnappings. The crisis also shed light upon the hopes of
          pro-seperatist citizens, who felt that violence was the method to
          adopt to break free from Canada. Eventually, it ended up implying that
          diplomatic action was the only solution, leading to the Quebec
          referendums.

          Historical Significance<br />
          The October Crisis marks a major moment of turmoil in Canadian
          history. The bombings, kidnappings, and violence that occured during
          the crisis shows that Canada is far from immune to terrorist
          organization, should the cause arise. Despite the measures taken by
          the government slowing down the independence movement, the event still
          established a disconnect between Quebec and the rest of Canada that
          continues today. For instance, the continuous battle can be seen
          through the Bloc Quebecois. Furthermore, the crisis has raised the
          question of how far the government can extend restrictions in order to
          resolve a crisis, and has shown the tip of the iceberg of restraining
          civil liberties.
