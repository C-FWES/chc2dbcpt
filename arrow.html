        <p>
          The Avro Arrow was commissioned by the Canadian government in 1953 in
          order to counter the threat of Soviet bombers attacking North America.
          The British aircraft manufacturing company A.V. Roe took on the task
          of producing the Arrow. More than 20 000 people were employed for this
          endeavor. In 1957,
          <span class="important-info"
            >John Diefenbaker
            <span class="tooltip-text">
              John Diefenbaker was the prime minister of Canada from 1957-1963,
              coined popularly as "Dief the Chief".
            </span>
          </span>
          was elected as prime minister, with the priority of cutting spending.
          Thus, the Arrow presented a challenge due to the high program cost of
          1.1 billion dollars. Additionally, on October 4, 1957, the Soviets
          revealed their Sputnik satellite. This made the Arrow technology seem
          obsolete, given that the threat of space-borne ballistic missiles was
          now a reality. Furthermore, countries such as the US were coming up
          with superior aircraft in terms of altitude in range. In consideration
          of these factors, the Avro Arrow program was canceled by Diefenbaker
          on February 20, 1959. All aircraft were dismantled and blueprints
          destroyed.

        <p>
          Why is this defining? <br />
          The Avro Arrow was a major contribution to Canada’s identity as a
          respectable nation. A major source of pride for Canadians, the Arrow
          featured record-breaking technology and established Canada as an
          aviation superpower. Thus, the cancellation of the Avro Arrow dealt a
          major blow to the status of Canada. Leverage was also given to other
          nations, such as the United States as Canada no longer had its
          capabilities as an aviation power. The dismissal of the Avro Arrow
          sheds light upon a shameful reversal in Canadian history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuity and Change <br>
          Although all the physical Avro Arrows were dismantled, it continued to
          leave an impact. The cancellation of the program left nearly 15 000
          skilled workers unemployed, a number of which emigrated to other
          countries to provide their valuable skill set. A good portion of
          engineers left Canada to work for NASA, employing an instrumental role
          in the moon landing mission. In addition, they continued to contribute
          to further endeavors like the shuttle mission. To supplement the air
          force, Canada was forced to settle for used Voodoo jets from the
          United States. The spirit of the Avro Arrow lives on, however;
          reportedly, an entire Arrow was smuggled out and landed in Britain,
          and a piece of the nose is kept in the Aviation and Space museum. The
          dream the Avro Arrow was meant to ignite has also somewhat surfaced,
          as Canada now boasts the fifth largest aerospace industry in the
          world.
