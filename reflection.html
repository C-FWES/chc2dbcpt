      Canada thrives in its fair share of shameful historical moments. For
      example, the conscription debate bitterly divided English and French
      Canadians and formed a disconnect that continues today. The forced
      internment of Japanese Canadians shed light upon the paranoia and
      anti-Asian sentiment that existed in Canada. The cancellation of the
      groundbreaking Avro Arrow destroyed a nation’s hopes and dreams to become
      a leading aerial power, and the October Crisis bore the limits of how far
      the government could restrict civil liberties. However, just as it is with
      anything else, failure is necessary for a nation to grow. These events and
      mistakes are ingrained in history for generations to view and learn, in
      order not to relive the demise that they had brought. In a way, these have
      even led to the betterment of Canada. For example, Canada is now known
      worldwide for being an accommodating and inclusive nation that accepts all
      people. The divide between French and English is closing due to increased
      education about French culture and respect for multiculturalism.
      Furthermore, Canada’s aviation capabilities are growing, as the nation now
      boasts the fifth largest aviation industry in the world. As a nation that
      had its downfalls but recovered, Canada is a nation to be proud of.
